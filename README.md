# Permafrost-Carbon-Dataset-Tibetan-Plateau
Using recent permafrost and soil organic carbon (SOC) observations over the Tibetan Plateau, we estimated the permafrost and SOC distribution during the baseline period (2006-2015) using data-driven approaches.

Description: 
  Using recent observations of mean annual ground temperature (MAGT) at or near (the closest to) the depth of zero annual amplitude, active layer thickness (ALT) and soil organic carbon (SOC) at different depth measured during the baseline period (2006-2015) over the Tibetan Plateau (TP), we estimate the permafrost distribution over TP, as well as the ALT and SOC distribution across the TP permafrost region during the same period using data-driven approaches.

  This datasets include four directories, which are respectively:
1.	Permafrost Map
Permafrost distribution in the baseline period (2006-2015)
  Value 1 denotes permafrost, value 2 denotes non-permafrost
2.	ALT Map

  unit: m
3.	SOC Map
  0-3 m Soil organic carbon distribution in the baseline period (2006-2015)
  unit: kg/m2
4.	TP Scope:
A shape file for the scope of Tibetan Plateau.
