Name: 
  Permfrost, Active layer Thickness and Soil Organic Carbon Maps over the Tibetan Plateau
Description:
  Using recent observations of mean annual ground temperature (MAGT) at or near (the closest to) the depth of zero annual amplitude, active layer thickness (ALT) and soil organic carbon (SOC) at different depth measured during the baseline period (2006-2015) over the Tibetan Plateau (TP), we estimate the permafrost distribution over TP, as well as the ALT and SOC distribution across the TP permafrost region during the same period using data-driven approaches.
How to Use the Data:
  Download the file "TP_permafrost_ALT_SOC_Map.zip"
